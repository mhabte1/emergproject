  All team members will finish stories and begin to gather all requirements for sprint 2 deliverable.


-Do you see any impediment that prevents you or the Development Team from meeting the Sprint Goal? What are the impediments? What is your impediment removal plan?

  The team did not see any impediments, but did discuss how we would handle them if we came across any. It was agreed on that we will inform team right away and get on a MS Team call to straighten out any blockers as a team.
